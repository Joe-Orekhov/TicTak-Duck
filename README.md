# TicTak-Duck
TickTack-Toe With ducks
We're going to be creating a Tick Tac Toe game with a Duck theme. The goals are laid out below in order of core functions and extra features we would like to add on top if we complete our core functions early. 

The user experience will be as follows:
1. Play Game button will enact the users to be able to select there Avatars name and choose to be "X" or "O" 
2. Once that process is complete the users will see a Tic Tac Toe board where they can begin play.
3. Once a "Win" & "Loss" or a "Draw" Has been decided the users will recive a prompt on either "Win", or "Draw"
4. From there if a winner has been decided that duck avatar name will be displayed in an alert popup. If a draw an alert for "Draw" will be displayed.
5.  After the game is completed the user will have a option to select game reset which will reset the game with the same Avatar names. (Extra new game button will reset the whole process ex. Play game button)


### Overall Core Functionality 
1. Play Game button
2. Avatar Name
3. Avatar inherits X or O properties
4. 9 clickable boxes that take in X or O but don't overwrite once selected
5. Computes the "Win" parameter 3 in a row 


### Board Functionality 
1. Board needs to recognize the "Win"
2. Board needs to recognize the "Tie"
3. Board needs to pick 3 blocks (in case of a double win)
4. Board needs to be clickable based on the player's turn
5. Reset button that resets the board with the same players.
6. Strike through the 3 winning blocks 


### Extra Functionality 
1. Build a scoreboard to keep track of how many "Wins, Ties, Losses" 
2. Build a comment section for players to say something example "GG"
3. War background to create "Dramatic effect between the ducks"
4. Confetti effect on screen for the winner (similar to FT Complete)
5. Divide the screen in two one duck on the right one on the left
